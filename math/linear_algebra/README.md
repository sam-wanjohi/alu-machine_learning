# Linear Algebra

## Overview

This project focuses on fundamental concepts in Linear Algebra using Python and Numpy. It includes understanding vectors, matrices, and their operations, including dot products, matrix multiplication, and broadcasting. The project leverages Numpy for efficient numerical computations and aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of linear algebra concepts and their applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- **General Concepts**
  - Explain what a vector and a matrix are.
  - Describe what a transpose is and how it affects a matrix.
  - Understand the shape of a matrix and what an axis is.
  - Perform slicing on vectors and matrices.
  - Conduct element-wise operations on matrices.
  - Concatenate vectors and matrices.
  - Compute dot products and perform matrix multiplication.
  - Utilize Numpy for linear algebra operations.
  - Understand parallelization and its importance in computations.
  - Grasp broadcasting and how it simplifies operations on arrays.

## Requirements

- **Python Scripts**
  - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
  - Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using Python 3.5
  - Files will be executed with Numpy version 1.15
  - All files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  - Code must follow `pycodestyle` version 2.5
  - All modules, classes, and functions must be documented
  - No imports are allowed unless specified
  - Files must be executable

- **Installation**
  - To install Python 3.5, follow the instructions for Ubuntu 16.04.
  - To install pip 19.1:
    ```bash
    wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
    sudo python3 get-pip.py
    rm get-pip.py
    ```
  - Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install --user numpy==1.15
    pip install --user scipy==1.3
    pip install --user pycodestyle==2.5
    ```

## Usage

1. **Running Scripts**: Execute Python scripts directly from the terminal. Ensure that the first line of each script is `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
