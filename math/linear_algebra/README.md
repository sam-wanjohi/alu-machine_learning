Linear Algebra
Overview
This project focuses on fundamental concepts in Linear Algebra using Python and Numpy. It includes understanding vectors, matrices, and their operations, including dot products, matrix multiplication, and broadcasting. The project leverages Numpy for efficient numerical computations and aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of linear algebra concepts and their applications.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

General Concepts
Explain what a vector and a matrix are.
Describe what a transpose is and how it affects a matrix.
Understand the shape of a matrix and what an axis is.
Perform slicing on vectors and matrices.
Conduct element-wise operations on matrices.
Concatenate vectors and matrices.
Compute dot products and perform matrix multiplication.
Utilize Numpy for linear algebra operations.
Understand parallelization and its importance in computations.
Grasp broadcasting and how it simplifies operations on arrays.

Files will be executed with Numpy version 1.15
All files should end with a new line
The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/env python3
Code must follow pycodestyle version 2.5
All modules, classes, and functions must be documented
No imports are allowed unless specified
Files must be executable
Installation

To install Python 3.5, follow the instructions for Ubuntu 16.04.
To install pip 19.1:
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
sudo python3 get-pip.py
rm get-pip.py
Install required packages:
pip install --user numpy==1.15
pip install --user scipy==1.3
pip install --user pycodestyle==2.5
Usage
Running Scripts: Execute Python scripts directly from the terminal. Ensure that the first line of each script is #!/usr/bin/env python3.
